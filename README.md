# UFC Fight Outcome Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fights using machine learning techniques. The prediction model will utilize fighter attributes and statistics to forecast the likelihood of a fighter winning or losing a match. The project involves various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Background
Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a combat sport that incorporates techniques from various disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, Muay Thai, and others. Predicting the outcomes of MMA fights can be challenging due to the complex interplay of fighter attributes, styles, and strategies. This project aims to leverage machine learning to provide insights into fight outcomes.

## Data Collection
The project involves collecting data on MMA fighters, including their attributes, fight statistics, and demographic information. Various sources, such as MMA databases, official fight records, and API services, can be utilized for data collection. For this project, I collected the dataset from kaggle.

## SQL Analysis
An initial step in the project involved performing SQL analysis on the collected data. This analysis may include querying databases, joining tables, filtering data, and aggregating statistics to gain insights into fighter performance and trends.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for machine learning tasks. This includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering focuses on creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model. This may involve deriving additional attributes from fighter statistics or incorporating domain knowledge into the feature selection process.

## Model Selection
The project involves selecting appropriate machine learning models for predicting MMA fight outcomes. Models such as logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and neural networks may be considered based on their suitability for the task.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The selected models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to optimize model performance.

## Model Deployment
Once trained and validated, the predictive model is deployed to make predictions on new data. This may involve building APIs, web applications, or integrating the model into existing systems for real-time prediction.

## Handling Class Imbalance
Since MMA fight outcomes may be imbalanced (e.g., more wins than losses), techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights are employed to address this issue and improve model performance.

## Interpretability and Explainability
Interpretability and explainability of the model are crucial for understanding how predictions are made. Techniques such as feature importance analysis and model explainability methods are employed to interpret the model's decisions.

## Iterative Improvement
The project follows an iterative process of evaluation and refinement based on new data and insights gained from model performance. Continuous monitoring and updates ensure the model remains accurate and relevant over time.
